# ELEC3204-MotorController

## Contents
This is the code written, tested and verified by Jeremy Lin, Daniel Mok and Sahaj Mand for the ELEC3204 Motor Controller Project in Semester 1 2025. The repository contains arduino code for motor control of a Pololu 12V Metal Geatmotor and a GUI to be used by a device that can connect to the Arduino to establish serial communication.

## Final Deliverable
The image below shows the final hardware implementation for the project.
